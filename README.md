<b>Shakey Safe Mobile Protector</b>

Shakey Safe Mobile Protector is an Android safety application designed to help users protect their mobile phones from theft in crowded public places such as markets, temples, buses, and railway stations.

The app works by detecting sudden phone movement. If someone snatches the phone quickly, the app immediately triggers a security response to alert a trusted person.

After installing the app, the user is required to accept the terms and conditions and save a trusted contact number. Once the security feature is active, any suspicious or sudden movement of the phone triggers an alert.

In case of a theft attempt, the app sends the phone’s live location to the saved contact number. Within 4 seconds, the app also places an automatic call to that contact. This quick response gives the user a chance to react and recover the phone before it is completely lost.

The app is designed to be simple and reliable, especially during emergency situations. If the user follows the required setup and terms mentioned inside the app, the safety features work effectively when needed.
